* Purchase Event Script Ideas

** Events count

   - We can use /localStorage/ to set our own /first_time_accessed/ key to /true/
     if it is the first time the events will trigger otherwise we will not trigger
     the /PURCHASE/ and /ADD_PAYMENT_INFO/ events.

     We can use something like this:

     #+BEGIN_SRC js
     // Check if the page is being visited for the first time ever (across sessions)
     if (!localStorage.getItem('visited')) {
       // Code to execute if the page is being visited for the first time
       console.log("Welcome! This is your first visit.");

       // Set a flag in localStorage to indicate that the user has visited the page
       localStorage.setItem('visited', true);

     } else {
       // Code to execute if the page is being refreshed
       console.log("Welcome back! You are refreshing the page.");
     }
     #+END_SRC
