* Attribution Analysis

** Google Ads (only gclid)
   Sometimes these type of orders are being tagged as *direct* orders. This can
   happen due to the following reasons:

*** Session Handling
    1. *Expired Session*: purchase happend after the session expiry time
       (typically 30 mins)
    2. *User Behaviour*: user returns to the site via a bookmark or by typing the
       URM directly after initially coming from a Google Ad.

*** Cross-domain Tracking issues
    1. *Missing ~gclid~ in Subsequent Visits*: subsequent visits by the user
       didn't carry ~gclid~
    2. *Cross-domain Navigation*: navigation b/w cross-domain or subdomain,
       ensuring the ~gclid~ can be challenging.
